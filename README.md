## Training students on how to use Git & Github

### All is purely hands-on


**GitHub Projects**: is a feature that allows users to organize and prioritize work in a flexible and visual way. Projects provide a way to track issues, pull requests, and other GitHub objects across multiple repositories and branches, making it easier to manage complex projects and collaborate with team members.  *By using projects, you can create a visual representation of your pipeline, which can help you keep track of the progress of individual tasks as well as the overall status of your pipeline*
